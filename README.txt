So far at this stage, I have began adding the evolutionary reactions for C4 evolution. (E.g. GDC, PEPCase, NADP-ME etc)
It's mostly done in the file "DuplicateAraModel_v2_bundlesheath".

I have started on another file "DuplicateAraModel_v2_NADP-ME" which attempts to 'evolve' the model into a NADP-ME subtype. But I'm going to create a new branch for this, step-4.
